# Development guide

[Home](../../README.md) · [简体中文](../zh-CN/development.md)

One overview for maintainers and AI agents. Read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) first: it holds the rules that must not be broken. This page explains how the code fits together; for details, read the code it points to.

## Scope

- Integration branch: `dev` (renamed from `develop`). Release history remains on `main`.
- Camera: Sony ILCE-7CM2, firmware 2.01 only.
- Product: the 3.0 desktop app (`desktop.py`), on Windows 10/11 x64 and macOS 14+ Apple Silicon. Windows and macOS share the GUI, planners, camera writes and recovery. Only USB drivers, privilege elevation and media handling differ per host.
- Legacy command-line tools (`FL23.cmd`, `lut.py`, `recovery.py`, `shutter.py`, `vertical.py`, `a7look_*.py`, `raw_*.py`) remain for advanced use. Their backup-based workflows are separate from the desktop's backup-free direct operations.

## Repository map

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `desktop.py` | Entry point: GUI, `--worker`, `--privileged-worker` (macOS), `--raw-profile-worker` (Lightroom), `--offline-self-test` |
| `src/desktopapp/` | GUI (`window.py`, `lookeditor.py`; colors and states in `theme.py`), jobs (`jobs.py`), worker dispatch (`worker.py`), one-click coordinator (`allinone.py`), dialog texts (`reloadguide.py`, `connectionguide.py`, `lookguide.py`, `completion.py`) |
| `src/desktopapp/actions/` | `catalog.py`: which actions touch the camera or need power confirmation. `look_compiler.py` and `sound.py`: adapters for offline conversion and the sound runtime |
| `src/desktopapp/platforms/` | Host-specific code: `usb_drivers.py` (Windows WinUSB via libwdi, UAC, uninstall), `windows_pnp.py`, `macos_authorization.py` (Terminal + sudo), `macos_media.py` |
| `src/looks/looktool/` | Core engines: `direct.py` (backup-free transactions), `bundle.py` (combined plan), `requestcleanup.py`, `compilelook.py` (DCP/CUBE → `.a7look`), `rawauto.py`/`rawidentity.py` (Lightroom), plus legacy checkpoint/job modules |
| `src/camera_runtime/` | USB service session (`transport.py`), FL23 planner/assets, macOS host helpers (`macos_host.py`), shared Sony-PMCA-RE under `src/fl23/vendor` |
| `src/shutter_sound/` | Sound conversion/volume, audition, persistent install; `native/` holds the AArch64 camera workers |
| `src/vertical/` | Vertical Display workers and portrait resources (**being rewritten**) |
| `src/fl23/` | Standalone legacy FL23 installer; its `native/` workers are reused by the engines |
| `plugins/A7LookAuto.lrplugin/` | Lightroom Classic auto-profile plugin |
| `calibration/` | Virtual 2.01 response model used by the compiler |
| `dev/desktop/` | Packaging (`build.py`, `desktop.spec`, `prepare_assets.py`, `prepare_presets.py`, `profilepack.py`) and the desktop test suite |
| `dev/shutter_sound/`, `dev/vertical/`, `dev/usb/` | Tests, emulators and research tools |
| `dev/release/` | Historical v2.x CLI release scripts and `check_publication.py` |
| `desktop-assets/` (ignored) | Distribution-only inputs: six default looks, paired profile library, Windows/macOS helpers |
| `build/`, `dist/` (ignored) | Caches, private evidence and build outputs |

Not every retained source file is a desktop feature. The independent CLI still uses `devicejob.py`, `devicecli.py` and the legacy FL23 modules. `fl23_color.py` rebuilds and checks donor color assets; `standalone.py` and `photobuild.build()` reproduce the bundled instruction templates for offline validation. Native worker sources have one canonical location under `src/fl23/native`. An import without a local variable use may be a public re-export (`jobs` action categories, macOS media helpers) or required path initialization (`files_worker` importing `candidate`). Check those roles before deleting it.

## How a button becomes a camera write

1. **GUI** (`window.launch`). Write actions show a power/model confirmation; the request then carries `power_confirmed=True`. The UI thread never calls camera, driver or native-worker code.
2. **Job** (`jobs.new_job`). Creates `<data root>/runs/<UTC time>-<action>-<id>/` with `request.private.json` (schema `a7c2-desktop-job/1`) and `status.private.json`.
3. **Worker** (`desktop.py --worker`). A fresh child process for every job. On macOS, camera actions first re-run the same worker as root through a per-job Terminal sudo script. The worker writes `worker.log` and sets the status to `RUNNING`, then `SUCCEEDED` with `result`, or `FAILED` with `error`, `error_type` and the full traceback.
4. **Dispatch** (`worker.run`). Routes the action to an engine (see the table below). Power confirmation is recorded by the executing backend; the desktop does not measure or print a battery percentage.
5. **GUI completion** (`window.finished`). Reads the status and `result.phase`, then shows the matching dialog: cold reload, resource reload, sound notice or completion.

`SUCCEEDED` only means the worker returned. The phase says what happens next:

| Phase | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `AWAITING_RELOAD` / one-click `WAIT_RELOAD` | Written and fully read back; the user must cold-reload |
| `AWAITING_RESOURCE_RELOAD` / `WAIT_RESOURCE_RELOAD` | Names written, programs not yet; cold-reload, then continue |
| `LOADED` / `COMPLETE` | Verified after a new boot (`COMPLETE` also records the owner's physical check) |
| `NEEDS_REVIEW` | Stopped. Keep the evidence; never replay an unknown write |

Data root: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\A7C2Tools` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/A7C2Tools` on macOS. Override it with `A7C2_DESKTOP_DATA`. GUI settings are stored in `desktop.json`.

## Action catalog

| Action | Engine | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setup_all` | `allinone.run` | One-click install/continue; calls the other actions in-process |
| `driver_scan`, `usb_prepare`, `driver_install`, `driver_uninstall`, `mac_unmount` | `platforms.usb_drivers` | Only `054C:0E8A` and `054C:0336`; existing WinUSB/libusbK/libusb0 bindings are kept |
| `connect`, `usb_stability` | `devicesession.Camera`, `usbcheck` | Read-only |
| `direct_factory_reset` / `direct_verify` | `looktool.direct` | Built-in factory reference; each request plans from current camera bytes |
| `direct_fl23_enable`, `direct_fl23_disable` | `looktool.direct` | |
| `direct_looks_import` (→ `direct_resume_looks`) | `lookbatch` + `looktool.direct` (`install_all`) | `operations`: `slot`, `action=write/restore`, `path`, optional `name` |
| `vertical_enable`, `vertical_disable` | `looktool.direct` (persistent) | Being rewritten |
| `sound_on`, `sound_off` | `looktool.direct` (`sound_enable/disable`) | |
| `sound_import`, `sound_volume` | `actions.sound` → `shutter_sound.sound_cli` | Computer only, no camera access |
| `sound_audition`, `sound_install`, `sound_verify`, `sound_restore_sound` | `actions.sound` | Camera actions |
| `compile_look` | `actions.look_compiler` → `looktool.compilelook` | Offline |
| `plugin_install` | `desktopapp.plugins` | Optional Lightroom plugin; bundles ExifTool |
| `restore`, `restore_auto`, `restore_verify` | `checkpointjob.Rollback` | Optional restoration from a selected or discovered complete backup |
| `backup_current` | `desktopapp.backup` | Optional read-only current project checkpoint; voice resources can be saved in a separate ZIP |

A replacement frontend only needs `jobs.new_job(action, arguments)` plus `jobs.worker_command(...)`, and must interpret phases as above. Keep the argument names used by `Window.common()` and the catalog.

## Core flows

**Direct transaction** (`looktool/direct.py`, `DirectJob`):
1. `plan()` is pure. It turns the camera's current bytes into target bytes and wanted settings, and changes only the regions each mode declares. `bundle.plan()` stacks several modes (FL23, looks, ST resets, sound, vertical) into one plan.
2. `run_direct()` order: capture current state → plan → save `PLANNED` → native preflight → names first, then program windows → full program readback → name resources → settings → WBI → `AWAITING_RELOAD`. Every step is journaled in `direct.private.json`.
3. If the read-only remount returns EBUSY after names are written, the job stops at `AWAITING_RESOURCE_RELOAD`. Programs are written in a fresh transaction after a verified new boot.
4. `verify_direct()` re-plans from current bytes and must find nothing left to change. It then checks RAM and saved settings, requires a changed `boot_id` (proof of a cold reload), and checks that loaded program spans match the disk. Factory reset also requires `/usr` to be mounted read-only.

**One-click install** (`allinone.py`, state in `setup.private.json`):
`READY → DRIVERS → PREPARED → INSTALLING → WAIT_RELOAD → (verify) → FINALIZING → COMPLETE`, with a `WAIT_RESOURCE_RELOAD` branch.
- `FINALIZING` adopts sound, installs the plugin and RAW mapping, and checks the persisted Vertical Display.
- After a failure, a child that failed before any write gets a fresh `install-retry-*` plan. Unknown results stop with their evidence intact.

**Factory restore:** the built-in reference `src/looks/assets/factory-regions-2.01.json` holds generic stock bytes only for the regions this project changes. It contains no full firmware and no body data. Bytes outside those regions, and body calibration, are preserved. Each restore request plans from current bytes; historical jobs do not gate new recovery (`requestcleanup.py`).

**Optional current backup:** the recovery page can create an existing-format `checkpoint.private.zip` containing current AP/CP programs, live/saved settings and the 68 name resources. Its provenance is `current-project-backup`: it can be selected for rollback but is excluded from automatic earliest-original discovery. The optional `voice-resources.private.zip` contains the twenty captured voice-guide files; it supplies voice data when a selected rollback needs to remove the voice disable guard. Neither backup is required for installation or built-in factory restoration. Official voice resources can instead be prepared locally from the user's own 2.01 update with `desktopapp.screenreader`; the application does not bundle them. Voice restoration uses 1 MiB chunks into fixed staging names, checks the complete file digest and atomically publishes each file before removing the disable guard.

**Voice space:** `voicelock.py` changes four existing instruction windows (20 bytes total): the native support leaf and three ordinary setting writers. The native setting and trigger are saved OFF. `voice_cleanup` first installs this disable plan and requests a cold reload; only a later request whose loaded guards match may delete the ten language audio BINs. Index files stay. `resource_files.c` admits only its compiled fixed paths and sizes/digests from the fresh inventory, remounts `/usr` read-only after each operation and publishes a restored file only after its full hash matches. Native emulation uses a synthetic filesystem and does not prove filesystem behavior under physical power loss or camera boot safety. Factory reset selects mechanical shutter, disables silent mode, restores the original sound path and requires the reload check before private sound-file cleanup and completion. AF audio settings are preserved.

**USB service entry** (`camera_runtime/transport.Session`):
1. Check the normal USB product string.
2. Authenticate.
3. Wait for `0336`.
4. Authenticate again.
5. Bind the body by property `00e70003` (hex-text serial digest).

If `0336` never appears and the camera returns to `0E8A`, the session cools down for 30 s and retries, up to 3 attempts. Nothing is sent to the camera after an authentication that never reached `0336`.

**Sound** (`src/shutter_sound/`): `media.py`/`native_codec.py` convert audio on the computer. `sound_cli.py` drives the workflow for both the desktop and `shutter.py`. `candidate.py`/`boot_sound.py`/`files_worker.py` build the fixed native changes. Audition and confirmation records are optional and never gate saving.

**Look conversion:** `compilelook.py` parses DCP LookTable/tone curves, or ST/sRGB CUBEs, and fits them to the native table with `calibration/a7c2-2.01.virtual.npz`. No Lightroom is needed. See [LUT formats](lut-formats.md) for supported inputs.

## Build and test

Use native 64-bit Python 3.11.

```text
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation -r desktop-requirements.txt pyinstaller==6.16.0 pytest==8.3.5
python -m pytest dev/desktop dev/shutter_sound/tests dev/vertical -q
python desktop.py
```

The root `conftest.py` blocks physical USB enumeration in every test. Other suites: `python -m unittest discover -s src/looks/tests`, `src/fl23/tests`, `src/camera_runtime/tests`, `dev/usb/tests`. Private fixtures (`A7C2_RESEARCH_FIXTURES`) are optional; without them those tests skip.

**Packaging:**
1. Prepare the ignored distribution assets: `python dev/desktop/prepare_assets.py`. Use `--preset-archive <zip>` to import the six defaults and the paired library from an exported pack or a Windows build; use `--export-presets <zip>` to create such a pack.
2. Build: `python dev/desktop/build.py`.

Outputs:
- **Windows:** `dist/A7C2Tools-Windows-x64.zip`. It contains `A7C2Tools.exe`, `_internal/`, `Profiles/` (paired library), both READMEs and `LICENSE`.
- **macOS (Apple Silicon only):** `dist/A7C2Tools-macOS-arm64.dmg`. The paired library lives inside the app (`desktop-assets/profile-library-v1`).
- `profilepack.py` refuses to package unless all 11 Fujifilm and 4 Ricoh color pairs are present. Monochrome pairs are allowed only if they meet the independent error limits (MAE ≤3/255, P95 ≤12/255).

CI: `.github/workflows/desktop-preview.yml` builds on native Windows and `macos-15` runners and uploads artifacts without publishing a Release. Updating `dev/desktop/native-build-request.json` triggers an Apple Silicon build. Keystone/Unicorn build from source on ARM64 (Xcode CLT, CMake 3.31.6); Zig is 0.13.0.

Packages have no Developer ID signature. Offline tests, packaged self-tests and byte readback do not prove camera boot safety, colors or sound. Physical acceptance is recorded separately in the [changelog](changelog.md).

## Documentation policy

Keep the documentation small:

| File | Audience |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` | Users: download, step-by-step guide, troubleshooting |
| `docs/*/lut-formats.md` | Users: supported LUT/DCP inputs |
| `docs/*/changelog.md` | Everyone: version history and test records |
| `docs/*/notices.md` | Everyone: sources and licenses |
| `docs/*/development.md` | Maintainers and AI: this page |
| `AGENTS.md` | AI: rules that must not be broken |

Every English page has a Simplified Chinese counterpart at the same path; keep them in sync. Don't add per-feature guides or research notes. Read the code, and record decisions in the changelog or commit messages instead. Historical documents remain in git history.
